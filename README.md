# CS 470 Semester Project

## _______________________________________________________________________________________

I originally had decided to create a RISK agent for the semester project but soon realized, after looking at the 
provided code, that most of the ideas that I wanted to implement has already been done. So, in the end, I decided
to start from stratch and make my own chess playing agent.

To do this I used several guides online and borrowed code for specific sections of my project. Most of the code is
mine that I wrote following several psuedocode templates on [Chess Programming Wiki]
(https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page), but the app portion of the code and ideas about opening moves come
from [Ansh Gaikwad](https://medium.com/dscvitpune/lets-create-a-chess-ai-8542a12afef).
